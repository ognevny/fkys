# FUCKING KILL YOURSELF!
This language is the only ***GOOD*** one. C++, python, or any other ***HIPSTER BULLSHIT*** that you use right now fails when compared ***FKYS!*** So just start using it now, look at the next paragraph to see how to build a compiler!

By the way, if you are a so called 'R*st' user, check out [FKYSOxyde](https://github.com/ognevnydemon/fkys-rs) because you like quote on quote 'safe code'.

# How to build a compiler
Run `make` in your terminal, and then run `./fkysc`
(It requires `g++` or `clang++` and `make` to build)  
OR compile `main.cpp` manually with your favourite compiler

# Pointer
In this programming language you have an integer array of 500 elements. (Integer limits: -2147483648 and 2147483647) You also have a pointer, which allows you to work with elements from the array. To move the pointer use `<` and `>`.

In the next code example, we go from cell 0 to cell 4.
```
>>>>><
```
# Working with cells

Use `+` and `-` to increment or decrement the value in the current cell.

In the next code example we make the value of the cell at 0 equal to 3.
```
++++-
```

Use `l` to set cell's value to 125

```
l---
```
 Now the value of the cell at 0 is equal to 122.

# Input and output

Use `o` to output current cell's value, use `p` to input the number from the console.

```
p---o
```
If we input 20, the code will output 17.
Also use `s` to output space, and use `n` to go to the next line.

# Output modes

What if you wanted to output text? Well you can do that. Use `c` to go into text output mode, and use `i` to go back to number output mode.
When you are in the text output mode, numbers are converted to characters using the ASCII table.
For example, the following code outputs `Hello, world!`

```
cl-----------------------------------------------------o
>l------------------------o+++++++oo+++o>+++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++os>l------o<<o+++o------o----
----o>-----------o
```

But if you remove the `c` at the start, the code will produce the next thing:
```
7210110810811144 11911111410810033
``` 

# Loops
Loops repeat until the current cell's value doesn't equal to 0.
For example, the next code outputs the ASCII table.
```
l[oscoin-]
```
Pssst, we are also gonna add the for loop, so stick with this project.

# Other stuff
Use `e` to exit the program.

### PS: many more features coming soon...
