# *FUCKING KILL YOURSELF!*
This language is the only ***GOOD*** one. C++, python, or any other ***HIPSTER BULLSHIT*** that you use right now fails when compared ***FKYS!***! So just start using it now, look at the next paragraph to see how to build a compiler!

# How to build a compiler:  
Run `make` in your terminal, and then run `./fkysc`
(It requires `g++` or `clang++` and `make` to build)  
OR compile `main.cpp` manually with your favourite compiler


# Commands:
```
e - exits the program
> - move pointer to the right
< - move pointer to the left
+ - increment cell by one
- - decrement cell
i - integer output mode (works by default)
c - character output mode
n - newline
s - prints space
o - prints the contents of the cell to the console
p - accepts input from the user into the cell 
[] - while loop (continues while the cell != 0)
l - set the current cell to 125
```

For example, the following code outputs ```Hello, world!``` to the console:
```
cl-----------------------------------------------------o
>l------------------------o+++++++oo+++o>+++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++os>l------o<<o+++o------o----
----o>-----------o
```
